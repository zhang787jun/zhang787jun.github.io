# TFJob


此教程主要培训描述一个tensorflow 的训练过程。

Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition
Kubernetes has a concept of Custom Resources (often abbreviated CRD) that allows us to create custom object that we will then be able to use. In the case of Kubeflow, after installation, a new TFJob object will be available in our cluster. This object allows us to describe a TensorFlow training.

TFJob Specifications
Before going further, let's take a look at what the TFJob object looks like:


**TFJob 定义的yml文件**

Field|Type|Description
apiVersion|string|Versioned schema of this representation of an object. In our case, it's kubeflow.org/v1beta1
kind|string|Value representing the REST resource this object represents. In our case it's TFJob
metadata|ObjectMeta|Standard object's metadata.
spec|TFJobSpec|The actual specification of our TensorFlow job, defined below.
spec is the most important part, so let's look at it too:

TFJobSpec Object

| Field         | Type                | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TFReplicaSpec | TFReplicaSpec array | Specification for a set of TensorFlow processes, defined below |



TFReplicaSpec Object

| Field         | Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TfReplicaType | string          | What type of replica are we defining? Can be MASTER, WORKER or PS. When not doing distributed TensorFlow, we just use MASTER which happens to be the default value. |
| Replicas      | int             | Number of replicas of TfReplicaType. Again this is useful only for distributed TensorFLow. Default value is 1.                                                      |
| Template      | PodTemplateSpec | Describes the pod that will be created when executing a job. This is the standard Pod description that we have been using everywhere.                               |
Here is what a simple TensorFlow training looks like using this TFJob object:

```yml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1beta1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  name: example-tfjob
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    MASTER:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - image: <DOCKER_USERNAME>/tf-mnist:gpu
              name: tensorflow
              resources:
                limits:
                  nvidia.com/gpu: 1
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```


创建 `tfjod.yaml` 如下：
```yml
apiVersion: kubeflow.org/v1beta1
kind: TFJob
metadata:
  name: module6-ex1-gpu
spec:
  tfReplicaSpecs:
    MASTER:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - image: <DOCKER_USERNAME>/tf-mnist:gpu # 从镜像中拉取
              name: tensorflow
              resources:
                limits:
                  nvidia.com/gpu: 1
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

```shell
kubectl create -f <template-path>
```
Let's look at what has been created in our cluster.
First a TFJob was created:

```shell
kubectl get tfjob
>>>
NAME              AGE
module6-ex1-gpu   5s
```


As well as a Pod, which was actually created by the operator:

kubectl get pod
Returns:

NAME                                            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
module6-ex1-master-xs4b-0-6gpfn                 1/1       Running     0          2m
Note that the Pod might take a few minutes before actually running, the docker image needs to be pulled on the node first.

Once the Pod's status is either Running or Completed we can start looking at it's logs:

kubectl logs <your-pod-name>
This container is pretty verbose, but you should see a TensorFlow training happening:

[...]
INFO:tensorflow:2017-11-20 20:57:22.314198: Step 480: Cross entropy = 0.142486

INFO:tensorflow:Final test accuracy = 88.4% (N=353)
[...]
That's great and all, but how do we grab our trained model and TensorFlow's summaries?

Well currently we can't. As soon as the training is complete, the container stops and everything inside it, including model and logs are lost.

Thankfully, Kubernetes Volumes can help us here. If you remember, we quickly introduced Volumes in module 2 - Kubernetes, and that's what we already used to mount the drivers from the node into the container. But Volumes are not just for mounting things from a node, we can also use them to mount a lot of different storage solutions, you can see the full list here.

In our case we are going to use Azure Files, as it is really easy to use with Kubernetes.

Exercise 2: Azure Files to the Rescue
Creating a New File Share and Kubernetes Secret
In the official documentation: Persistent volumes with Azure files, follow the steps listed under Create storage account, Create storage class, and Create persistent volume claim. Be aware of a few details first:

It is very important that you create your storage account in the same region and the same resource group (with MC_ prefix) as your Kubernetes cluster: because Azure File uses the SMB protocol it won't work cross-regions. AKS_PERS_LOCATION should be updated accordingly.
While this document specifically refers to AKS, it will work for any K8s cluster
Once the PVC is created, you will see a new file share under that storage account. All subsequent modules will be writing to that file share.
PVC are namespaced so be sure to create it on the same namespace that is launching the TFJob objects
If you are using RBAC might need to run the cluster role and binding: see docs here
Once you completed all the steps, run:

kubectl get pvc
Which should return:

NAME             STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
azurefile        Bound     pvc-346ab93b-4cbf-11e8-9fed-000d3a17b5e9   5Gi        RWO            azurefile      5m
Updating our example to use our Azure File Share
Now we need to mount our new file share into our container so the model and the summaries can be persisted. Turns out mounting an Azure File share into a container is really easy, we simply need to reference our PVC in the Volume definition:

[...]
 containers:
  - image: <IMAGE>
    name: tensorflow
    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
    volumeMounts:
      - name: azurefile
        subPath: module6-ex2-gpu
        mountPath: /tmp/tensorflow
 volumes:
  - name: azurefile
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: azurefile
Update your template from exercise 1 to mount the Azure File share into your container, and create your new job.

Once the container starts running, if you go to the Azure Portal, into your storage account, and browse your tensorflow file share, you should see something like that:

file-share

This means that when we run a training, all the important data is now stored in Azure File and is still available as long as we don't delete the file share.
